- Defined niter = maximal number of iterations in ops_init: niter = 3 for NOx, = 1 otherwise
- passed cnox1 = cnox(ircp) from ops_main - ops_reken - ops_resist_rek - ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox
- set up an iteration in ops_main, no convergence check yet
- Extra initialisations at begin of iteration -> ops_init_iter
- road-correction formula vdHout in ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox, l_road_corr = .true. for testing, ozone concentration fixed at 90 ug/m3
- ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox: if (l_road_corr) replaced by if (disxx < dist_road_corr); dist_road_corr = 3500 m
- removed nroad_corr and made cnox 1D-array: cnox(nrrcp)
- dist_road_corr is now local variable in ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox
- removed routine m_ops_road_corr; vdHout is now in m_ops_vchem
- ops_init.f90: nam_subsec = CNAME_SUBSEC -> if (nsubsec .gt. 0) nam_subsec = CNAME_SUBSEC (possible crash if nsubsec = 0)
- introduced co3_test(NSEK) for wind rose of ozone concentration in ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox; test data.
  isec_prelim (preliminary wind sector) passed from ops_reken to ops_resist_rek to ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox.
- introduced o3bggrid = grids of O3 background concentrations per wind sector [ug/m3], everywhere we had nh3bggrid, but only needed for icm = 2 (NOx).
- introduced o3bg_rcp = O3 background concentrations at receptor [ug/m3], everywhere we had nh3bg_rcp, but only needed for icm = 2 (NOx) and
  not in ops_resist_rc_all. o3bg_rcp passed to ops_vchem_ratio_no2_nox and used there instead of co3_test.
- unit for so2bggrid, no2bggrid, nh3bggrid: [ppb] (read as ug/m3, converted to ppb) -> in subroutine headers
- tested new SetAverage to define average including missing values in o3bggrid -> is ok
